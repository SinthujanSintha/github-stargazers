### To fetch the data from Graph-Ql ApI to client, This App used React [Apollo client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) which is a comprehensive state management library for JavaScript that enables us to manage both local and remote data with GraphQL. Use it to fetch, cache, and modify application data, all while automatically updating your UI.
